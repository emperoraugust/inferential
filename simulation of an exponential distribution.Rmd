The goal of the project is to investigate a  0.2-exponential distribution in R and the distribution of avarages of 40 0.2-exponentials.

 
###Comparition between theoretical mean  and sample mean
First of all we construct the sample means.


```{r sampleexp}
set.seed(20893)
lambda<-.2
n<-40
nsim<-1000
sample<-matrix(data = rexp(n*nsim,lambda),nrow = 40,
               ncol = 1000)
sampleMeans<-colMeans(sample)
str(sampleMeans)
mean(sampleMeans)

```

The mean of the sample is `r mean(sampleMeans)`. It is close to the theoretical mean 1/lambda = `r 1/lambda`
